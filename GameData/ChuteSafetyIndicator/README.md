## INSTALLATION
Copy the ChuteSafetyIndicator folder and all its contents into your KSP GameData folder.

## FEATURES
This plugin will change the background color of each parachute's staging icon based on the current safety status.

Safe: green

Risky: yellow

Unsafe: red

You can also enable a setting which will prevent staged chutes from deploying until it's safe to do so.

## SETTINGS
The settings window can be launched from the stock application launcher or blizzy78's toolbar.

"Use stock toolbar" will toggle the button in the stock launcher on and off (only available if you have blizzy78's toolbar installed)

"Only deploy when safe" will prevent staged chutes form deploying until safe to do so.

"Clear icon backgrounds" will remove the default gray gradient background that's present on the staging icons.

You may also adjust the safe/risky/unsafe colours using the sliders to adjust the (R)ed, (G)reen, (B)lue and (A)lpha (transparency) components.  If you have "only deploy when safe" enabled, 
the "risky" colour will also be used on the chute icon (with the default background) to show that the chute is active but not yet deployed.
