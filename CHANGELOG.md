##CHANGELOG

1.0.2 - 2015/08/06
- added a new "clearBackground" setting to the config file which will completely remove the grey gradient texture from the stack icon background.
Setting this to "true" should make it easier for colour blind users to find a workable color combination.

1.0.1 - 2015/07/31
- stack icons will now only change colour when the vessel is actually in the atmosphere.

1.0.0 - 2015/07/19
- initial release
